## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **<a href="https://discord.js.org/" target="_blank">discord.js</a>**: A powerful Node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API, enabling rich functionality for managing roles and handling server events.
- **<a href="https://pnpm.io/" target="_blank">pnpm</a>**: Recommended for faster and more efficient dependency management.
- **<a href="https://github.com/Re2team/connectqueue" target="_blank">connectqueue</a>**: For better performance, especially in high-traffic Discord servers, using the `connectqueue` system is recommended to manage and process tasks in a queue efficiently.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or higher
- A Discord bot token
- A Discord server with appropriate roles
- `pnpm` installed globally (optional, but recommended)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/i6h/priority-bot.git
    cd priority-bot
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    If you prefer to use `pnpm`, install dependencies with:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use `npm`:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure the bot**:

    Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your Discord bot credentials and webhook URL:

    ```env
    TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
    GUILD_ID=your_guild_id
    CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
    WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url
    ```

4. **Customize the bot**:

    Open `config.js` and set up your roles and allowed roles:

    ```javascript
    const config = {
        token: process.env.TOKEN, // dont touch !!!
        guildId: process.env.GUILD_ID, // dont touch !!!
        clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID, // dont touch !!!
        webhookUrl: process.env.WEBHOOK_URL, //dont touch !!!

        commandsLocked: false,
        allowedRoles: ['your_allowed_role_id', 'your_allowed_role_id2'],
        roles: [
            { name: 'Owner', value: 'role_id' },
            { name: 'Admins', value: 'role_id' },
            { name: 'anything', value: 'role_id' }
        ]
    };
    ```

5. **Optional: Set up the `connectqueue` system**:

    For better compatibility with various Discord setups, integrate the `connectqueue` system. Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/Re2team/connectqueue" target="_blank">connectqueue GitHub page</a> to set it up.


6. **Run the bot**:

    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```

    Or, if you‚Äôre using `npm`:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## üìã Usage

Priority Bot offers several slash commands to manage roles effectively:

### 1. `givepriority`

**Assigns a temporary priority role to a user for a specified duration.**

- **Usage**: 
  ```plaintext
  /givepriority user:@Username priority:<Role> time:<Duration>
  ```

- **Example**: 
  ```plaintext
  /givepriority user:@its4lion priority:Gold time:1h
  ```
  This assigns the "Gold" role to `@its4lion` for 1 hour.

### 2. `removepriority`

**Removes an assigned priority role from a user before its expiration time.**

- **Usage**:
  ```plaintext
  /removepriority user:@Username
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```plaintext
  /removepriority user:@its4lion
  ```
  This removes the priority role from `@its4lion`.

### 3. `list`

**Lists all users who currently have an assigned priority role, along with the remaining time for each role.**

- **Usage**:
  ```plaintext
  /list page:<PageNumber>
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```plaintext
  /list page:1
  ```
  This displays the first page of users with assigned priority roles.

### 4. `togglelock`

**Toggles the lock state of the commands. When locked, only users with specific roles can use the bot‚Äôs commands.**

- **Usage**:
  ```plaintext
  /togglelock
  ```

  This toggles the command lock state.

### 5. `checkplayer`

**Check the current priority status of a user, including role and remaining time.**

- **Usage**:
  ```plaintext
  /checkplayer user:@Username
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```plaintext
  /checkplayer user:@its4lion
  ```
  This checks the current priority status of `@its4lion`.

## üõ°Ô∏è Practical Examples

### Granting Temporary Access

Grant a user temporary access to a special channel by assigning them a "VIP" role for 24 hours:

```plaintext
/givepriority user:@Lion priority:VIP time:24h
```

### Handling Expired Roles

The bot automatically removes roles when they expire, so you don‚Äôt need to manually track expiration times.

### Monitoring Active Roles

Use the `/list` command to keep track of who currently has priority roles and when those roles will expire:

```plaintext
/list page:1
```

### Checking Player Status

Quickly check the current status of any user using the `/checkplayer` command:

```plaintext
/checkplayer user:@Username
```

### Command Locking

Toggle the command lock with `/togglelock` to restrict command usage to specific roles (configured in `config.js` under `allowedRoles`). This is useful for ensuring that only trusted users can manage roles.
